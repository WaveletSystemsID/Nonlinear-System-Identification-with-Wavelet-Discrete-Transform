Include the "Common" path in your working directory, it contains useful functions.

WAFdemo : adaptative filter with Wavelet trasform as orthogonal whitening transform. Works well but its not for our purposes.

MWAFdemo: wavelet subband transformation (DWT) with Matlab toolbok. Slow and has some problems.

SWAFdemo: Efficient Real-Time DWT and subband adaptive filters. Only HAAR transform and 2 levels. Only works with a single delta 
as unknown system. 
TODO# : add more layer and wavelet family (db2 and db4 atleast), fix problem with time lag and filters delay. fix problems with synthesis.
